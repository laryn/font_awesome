## Changes from the library version

1. The filenames for the `solid` icons have been changed slightly to fit the
pattern of other icons used with Backdrop's icon API, by appending `-fill` to
denote that they are the filled (or solid) version of the font. This allows
a module like Icon Browser to filter on solid icons more reliably.

2. The icon SVGs have had `fill="currentColor"` added to make recoloring of the
icons simpler.
